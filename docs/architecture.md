# GoLinks Architecture

GoLinks follows the Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) design pattern. This architecture ensures that the core business logic is isolated from external concerns such as databases, web frameworks, and third-party services.

## Layers

### Domain Layer (`internal/domain`)
The innermost layer containing the core business entities and rules. It has no dependencies on any other layer or external libraries.
- **Entities**: `Link`, `LinkStats`.
- **Ports**: Interfaces defining how the domain interacts with the outside world (e.g., `LinkRepository`).

### Application Layer (`internal/domain/service.go`)
Contains the application services that orchestrate the business use cases. It depends only on the domain layer.
- **Services**: `LinkService`.

### Adapter Layer (`internal/adapter`)
The outermost layer that implements the ports defined in the domain layer. It interacts with external systems.
- **Driving Adapters**: HTTP handlers (`internal/adapter/http`) that receive requests and call application services.
- **Driven Adapters**: Database repositories (`internal/adapter/postgres`, `internal/adapter/sqlite`, `internal/adapter/memory`) that implement the repository interfaces to store and retrieve data.

## Dependency Rule
Dependencies always point inwards. The adapter layer depends on the application and domain layers, but the domain layer depends on nothing.
